# Final.rds Dataset Analysis - Complete Summary

## Analysis Overview

This comprehensive analysis of the `final.rds` dataset provides insights into Epic in-basket workload patterns across 64 healthcare providers. The dataset represents processed Epic EHR data with metrics spanning multiple months of provider activity.

## Key Findings Summary

### 📊 Dataset Composition
- **64 providers** across 3 types: MDs (26), NPs (4), RFs (34)
- **27 variables** including workload, response times, and system utilization
- **Complete dataset** with no missing values
- **Time span**: Average ~11 months per provider

### 🔍 Major Insights

#### 1. **Workload Disparities**
- **MDs** handle the highest message volume (775 avg) but have moderate in-basket hours (35.4 avg)
- **NPs** have the highest individual in-basket hours (54.0 avg) despite lower message volume
- **RFs** have the lowest workload across all metrics (23.7 in-basket hours, 289 messages)

#### 2. **Message Type Patterns**
- **Medical Advice Requests** are the most common (216 avg) and correlate strongly with workload
- **Prescription Messages** have the fastest response times (0.448 days avg)
- **Result Messages** have the slowest response times (4.39 days avg)

#### 3. **System Utilization**
- Strong correlation (0.899) between in-basket hours and total system hours
- High in-basket workload correlates with increased after-hours work (0.748)
- Some providers logging over 500 hours of after-hours work

#### 4. **Efficiency Metrics**
- **MDs** are most efficient (20.5 messages per in-basket hour)
- **RFs** are least efficient (12.3 messages per in-basket hour)
- Wide variation in response times (0-17 days)

### 📈 Critical Patterns

#### Top Performers
- All top 10 providers by message volume are MDs
- Range: 1,163 to 1,998 messages per provider
- One provider handles nearly 2,000 messages with excellent response times (0.283 days)

#### Outliers Identified
- 1 provider with extreme in-basket workload
- 2 providers with unusually long response times
- 3 total outliers requiring attention

### 🎯 Clinical Implications

#### Workload Inequity
- Significant disparities between provider types
- Some individual providers with unsustainable workloads
- Need for workload redistribution strategies

#### Response Time Concerns
- Wide variation in response times across message types
- Results messages taking longest to process
- Opportunity for automated responses

#### After-Hours Burden
- High correlation between workload and after-hours work
- Some providers logging excessive after-hours time
- Need for coverage and scheduling optimization
