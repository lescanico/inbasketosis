A retrospective analysis of provider-to-patient secure messages: how much are they increasing, who is doing the work, and is the work happening after hours? JMIR Medical Informatics, 8(7), e16521.
Study Design: Retrospective quantitative study (cohort analysis) of electronic patient portal messaging in a large health system.
Methods & Data: Analyzed secure message logs over several years to measure growth in patient-initiated messages, identify which staff (physicians vs. team members) responded, and determine timing of responses. Portal adoption rates and message volumes were tracked, and timestamps were used to flag after-hours work. No intervention was applied; this was an observational data analysis of messaging trends and workload distribution.
Key Findings: Patient portal use and message volume grew dramatically over the study period. Portal enrollment increased (e.g. from ~33% to 62% of patients with visits), and the number of patient-initiated messages nearly tripled in some specialties compared to earlier years. Physicians performed the majority of message responses (“who is doing the work”), indicating limited task delegation. A substantial portion of messages were handled during evenings or weekends, contributing to “pajama time” (after-hours EHR work). In short, electronic messaging became a significant, unmeasured addition to clinicians’ workload.
Practical Relevance: This study highlights the in-basket burden from rising portal messages, much of which falls on physicians and often occurs after hours. The results frame this as “invisible EHR labor,” since it isn’t captured by traditional productivity metrics. For outpatient psychiatry (or any ambulatory specialty), the implications are that unmanaged message volume can quietly consume provider time and potentially contribute to burnout. Quantifying the volume and timing of portal messages was an important first step in acknowledging and addressing this hidden workload in the EHR inbox.

Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis comparing EHR inbox message volume before vs. during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2018–June 2021) across a large outpatient network.
Methods & Data: Used de-identified Epic Signal™ log data from 419 physicians in primary care, medical specialties, and surgical specialties. Calculated mean daily message counts per physician (overall and by category: patient medical advice requests, prescription refills, calls, team/staff messages, system alerts) and average daily time spent in the inbox before COVID (pre-March 2020) vs. during COVID (March 2020 onward). Employed piecewise linear regression (spline at March 2020) to assess changes.
Key Findings: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 led to a surge in patient-generated messages. In primary care, daily patient medical advice request messages more than doubled (increase of ~105%) after COVID’s start (1.8 to 3.9 messages/day on average). Surgical and specialty practices saw even larger relative jumps in patient messages (albeit from lower baseline volumes). Total inbox messages per day rose modestly for primary care (+2.2%), but patient-originated messages drove a significant portion of new workload. Mean time spent on the inbox each day increased by ~15–17% in primary care during the pandemic. The elevated message volume and inbox time persisted through 2021. The authors note that patients did not substitute other communication (telephone calls remained stable), so the message increase was additive work.
Practical Relevance: The COVID-era shift toward remote care and messaging substantially added to clinicians’ in-basket work. Health systems should recognize that inbox volume spikes (like those during COVID) create ongoing workload pressure. Especially in fields like psychiatry – which often rely on frequent patient communications – similar trends could exacerbate burnout. This study underscores the need for strategies (policy or tech-assisted) to reduce inbox burden during crises and beyond, while still maintaining patient access.

Study Design: Retrospective observational study using EHR audit logs to measure changes in ambulatory care clinicians’ EHR use (including inbox work) from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic onset. (This was essentially a natural experiment analysis using Epic Signal data across specialties.)
Methods & Data: Aggregated weekly EHR active use time and message metrics from June 2019–February 2020 (pre-COVID) vs. March 2020–April 2022 (post-COVID onset) for physicians in a multi-center U.S. health system. Stratified by specialty (primary care vs. medical subspecialists vs. surgeons) and by high-volume vs. lower-volume clinicians. Primary measures: weekly patient message volume and telephone call volume, and weekly active EHR time (during clinic hours vs. after hours). Statistical tests compared means pre vs. post.
Key Findings: The pandemic’s onset corresponded with persistent increases in both patient messages and total EHR time for clinicians. In March 2020, weekly patient medical advice request messages jumped sharply and remained elevated thereafter. Primary care physicians received the highest volume – ~16 patient advice messages/week on average post-COVID, up from ~8 before (approximately doubling for PCPs). Meanwhile, mean active EHR time per week rose for all groups: PCPs’ EHR time increased by +6.5% (from ~10.6 to 11.3 hours/week), medical specialists by +9.9%, surgeons by +5.2%. Even high-clinical-volume physicians showed similar trends. Notably, telephone call volumes did not drop (no substitution effect), so the message surge was net new work. The authors conclude the increased portal message load is a “sustained, ongoing source of physician work” requiring system-level solutions.
Practical Relevance: This study reinforces that after COVID, clinicians are spending even more time tethered to the EHR, including managing inbox messages. It highlights how external factors (like a pandemic) can rapidly intensify “invisible” workloads. For outpatient mental health providers, who often manage many patient communications, such trends could compound burnout. The finding that inbox work remained higher post-pandemic suggests that health systems must prioritize interventions to manage inbox volume and support clinicians (e.g. by automation or staffing adjustments) in order to protect their well-being.

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of primary care clinicians examining the relationship between rising portal message volume and time spent on the EHR outside work hours (so-called “pajama time”).
Methods & Data: Conducted at Cleveland Clinic Health System, analyzing 150 PCPs’ EHR usage from 2019 through 2021. Used group-based trajectory modeling to categorize clinicians into low, moderate, or high message-volume groups based on quarterly incoming patient message counts. Compared changes in quarterly message volume and visit volume from Q4 2019 to Q4 2021. The primary outcome was EHR time outside scheduled hours (from Epic logs). Mixed-effects regression assessed association between message volume and after-hours EHR time.
Key Findings: Portal message volume increased substantially over the study period, while visit volumes slightly declined (as virtual care increased). Mean quarterly messages per clinician nearly doubled from 340 in late 2019 to 695 by late 2021. Clinicians in the highest trajectory group were handling ~840 messages/quarter (~65% more than moderate-volume peers). Across all clinicians, each additional 10 patient messages received per quarter was associated with 12 minutes of extra after-hours EHR time (per quarter) on average. Notably, after-hours time rose modestly for everyone during COVID, and there was no statistically significant difference in after-hours time between the high- vs. low-volume message groups – suggesting that all PCPs felt some impact. In summary, inbox messages were correlated with incremental after-hours work for individuals, but high message load alone did not fully explain the variation in after-hours time (indicating other factors also contribute to pajama time).
Practical Relevance: The study confirms that surging portal messages do translate into more after-hours EHR work for physicians, albeit in small increments. Even if high-message-volume doctors did not have dramatically more pajama time than others, every doctor experienced a time burden from messaging. For outpatient psychiatry, which often has lower visit counts but substantial messaging (e.g., medication refills, patient questions), such added minutes can accumulate and contribute to clinician fatigue. The authors suggest that interventions like triaging messages or allocating work time for inbox management could help, since message-related work otherwise spills into personal time. Overall, this evidence supports treating patient messaging as part of clinicians’ workload that must be managed to prevent burnout.

Study Design: Mixed-method (time-motion observation plus EHR log analysis) study quantifying how primary care physicians (PCPs) spend their workday, especially on the EHR vs. direct patient care.
Methods & Data: 57 physicians in family medicine clinics were directly observed over hundreds of clinic hours, and their EHR event logs were collected. The time-motion observers recorded time spent on clinical vs. administrative tasks (documentation, inbox, etc.) during a typical day (including after-clinic work in the evening). EHR log data were used to validate and augment the observed time on various EHR activities (e.g., notes, orders, messaging).
Key Findings: PCPs spend an extraordinary amount of time on EHR and desk work, relative to patient-facing time. On average, clinicians devoted 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday to EHR tasks and desk work. This included about 4.5 hours during clinic sessions on computer tasks and an additional 1.4 hours of after-hours EHR work each day (“pajama time”). Importantly, inbox management was a notable component of this workload – the study found physicians spent a significant portion of their day processing in-basket messages, results, and emails (nearly 1 hour per day on average for inbox and clerical tasks). Face-to-face patient time was only a fraction of the workday, with the rest being “invisible” electronic and administrative labor. The authors famously summarized that for every hour of direct clinical time, physicians spent nearly two hours on EHR/desk work – highlighting the imbalance.
Key Findings (Burnout Link): Though not a burnout study per se, the findings implied that this high clerical burden likely contributes to burnout. Later research confirmed this: heavy EHR time (especially after hours) and high inbox volume were associated with physician exhaustion.
Practical Relevance: This landmark study introduced the metaphor of doctors being “tethered to the EHR.” It empirically demonstrated the invisible labor (including in-basket tending) that consumes physicians’ days. In outpatient psychiatry, where documentation of therapy notes plus messaging with patients/families can be extensive, similar patterns may hold – meaning psychiatrists also spend substantial unseen hours on the computer. The implication is that health systems must redesign workflows and EHR tools to reduce this burden (e.g. by delegating certain inbox tasks, improving note efficiency, or using scribes/automation). Otherwise, the imbalance of administrative vs. clinical time can drive dissatisfaction and burnout.

Study Design: Systematic review of published studies examining how EHR use and features relate to healthcare provider burnout. This review synthesized quantitative and qualitative evidence across many settings.
Methods & Data: The authors searched the literature (through 2020) for studies linking any aspect of electronic health record use to clinician burnout or stress outcomes. They included 30+ studies (with physicians and some other providers) that met inclusion criteria. Data on study design, EHR metrics (e.g. after-hours time, message volume, usability scores), and burnout measures were extracted. They then qualitatively summarized findings and assessed strength of evidence for various EHR-burnout associations.
Key Findings: The review found consistent evidence that certain EHR-related factors are associated with higher burnout. Common themes included: excessive time spent on EHR documentation, high volume of inbox messages, home time on EHR (“pajama time”), and poor EHR usability were all correlated with provider burnout or emotional exhaustion in multiple studies. For example, studies showed that physicians who spent more time after hours on the EHR or handled more portal messages were significantly more likely to report burnout symptoms. Conversely, efficient EHR use and better user satisfaction were linked to lower burnout odds. Importantly, EHR factors were not usually the sole cause of burnout, but they were clear contributors. The review also noted that interventions like workflow changes or team documentation could mitigate some EHR-related burnout (though rigorous intervention studies were few at the time). In sum, “the use of EHRs contributes to healthcare provider burnout”, largely via increased workload and stress.
Practical Relevance: This comprehensive review underlines that EHR workload and design problems are significant drivers of burnout. In the context of in-basket management: having an overflowing inbox and spending long hours doing EHR clerical work are exactly the stressors implicated in burnout. For outpatient mental health clinicians, whose EHR demands (documenting lengthy notes, responding to patient messages) can be intense, the review’s findings are a warning. They suggest that improving EHR usability, automating certain tasks, and reallocating inbox work (e.g., with team support or AI tools) could meaningfully reduce burnout risk. Overall, this evidence base justifies efforts to streamline EHR workflows and reduce the cognitive load on clinicians as a burnout prevention strategy.

Study Design: Cross-sectional survey and economic analysis. The study surveyed physicians at an academic medical center to assess burnout and intention to leave, then modeled what portion of physician turnover is attributable to burnout and calculated the financial cost of that burnout-related turnover.
Methods & Data: All physicians at Stanford Medicine were surveyed using a validated burnout instrument. They also gathered data on whether physicians had plans to reduce clinical hours or leave the organization (turnover intent). Using regression, they estimated the independent effect of burnout on turnover intentions. Then, using institutional data on actual physician departures and known recruitment/replacement costs, they estimated the two-year cost of burnout-linked turnover.
Key Findings: Burnout had a profound impact on physicians’ likelihood of leaving. Physicians with signs of burnout were more than twice as likely to plan on leaving their practice or reducing their clinical effort compared to those without burnout. The authors attributed a substantial fraction of actual physician turnover to burnout. In their case institution, they estimated that over two years, 13–17% of physician departures were attributable to burnout. The financial cost of this burnout-related turnover was enormous – roughly $15 million to $55 million in two-year recruitment and replacement costs for the institution. (Nationally, similar analyses have pegged burnout-related costs in the billions of dollars.) This study provided a stark monetary value on the consequences of not addressing burnout.
Practical Relevance: While not about the EHR per se, this study is a critical reminder of what is at stake with physician burnout. It quantifies burnout as not only a human problem but also a huge financial liability for healthcare systems. In the context of EHR inbox workload and clinician burnout, Hamidi et al. strengthen the argument that investing in solutions (hiring staff, implementing supportive technologies, redistributing work) is worth the cost. If burdens like an overloaded in-basket contribute to burnout, and burnout in turn drives expensive turnover, then alleviating that burden is both a wellness strategy and a financially sound strategy. For outpatient psychiatry, where burnout rates are high (and replacing psychiatrists is costly), reducing “invisible work” and EHR stressors could improve retention and save money in the long run.

Full Citation: Lieu, T. A., Altschuler, A., Weiner, J. Z., et al. (2019). Primary care physicians’ experiences with and strategies for managing electronic messages. JAMA Network Open, 2(12), e1918287.
Study Design: Qualitative study (semi-structured interviews) of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a large group practice, focusing on how they manage their electronic inbox (EHR in-basket) and the challenges it creates.
Methods & Data: Conducted 24 in-depth interviews with PCPs and local physician leaders at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2018. Participants included 15 frontline PCPs and 9 clinic chiefs, sampled from various clinics. Interviewers asked about the effects of electronic messaging on practice, perceived stressors from inbox work, and any individual or team strategies to handle the message workload. Transcripts were coded and analyzed for themes. The study also collected basic data on participants and their practice characteristics.
Key Findings: Physicians reported that the volume of electronic messages had fundamentally changed their workday and introduced new stress. Many PCPs felt overwhelmed by the number of inbox notifications they receive daily (often 70+ messages per day in various categories). A common sentiment was that patients now expect rapid responses, effectively “unbounding” the clinical day and adding pressure to constantly check and clear the inbox. Doctors described adopting a wide array of personal coping strategies to manage the deluge: for example, carving out specific times for inbox work, using one-touch processing rules (handling each message only once), setting patient expectations about response times, and delegating certain messages to nurses or staff when possible. At the organizational level, approaches varied – some clinics had a “triage pool” or standing orders for staff to handle routine messages, whereas others left most of the burden on individual physicians. Despite these strategies, many PCPs felt that message management was a constant, stressful addition to their practice that wasn’t accounted for in schedules or productivity metrics. The Conclusions note that while physicians have improvised many management tactics, the inbox workload creates new stressors in primary care, and system-level support (training, team-based coverage) is needed.
Practical Relevance: This study provides a ground-level view of the “in-basket struggle.” It highlights that individual clinicians in outpatient settings often bear the brunt of inbox management with little formal support, leading to frustration and burnout feelings. The finding that doctors employ so many varied tactics suggests no one solution is in place – and that best practices could be shared. For outpatient psychiatry, where similar messaging issues arise (e.g., patient queries between visits), the lessons are: (1) without structured support, clinicians will feel the pressure to personally keep up at all costs, and (2) leadership should implement team-based inbox workflows and training so that managing messages doesn’t depend purely on individual heroics. In short, this study pushes for acknowledging inbox management as a core part of ambulatory care and designing workflows to make it sustainable.

Study Design: Mixed-methods study combining a national survey of primary care practitioners with in-depth interviews. It aimed to identify concrete strategies and design improvements to alleviate EHR inbox burden, based on frontline clinicians’ experiences.
Methods & Data: The authors first analyzed responses from a Veterans Affairs national survey (which had asked primary care providers for suggestions to improve the EHR inbox). Then, they conducted follow-up interviews with 20 physicians across five health systems (including VA and others) to gather detailed insights on inbox management pain points and solutions. Using qualitative analysis, they categorized the recommendations. Finally, they synthesized results into key areas for EHR designers and healthcare organizations to target.
Key Findings: Clinicians had clear and recurrent recommendations to fix the inbox. Five major themes emerged for reducing inbox overload:
Reduce low-value notifications: Physicians urged that inbox messages should be relevant to patient care and to the physician’s role. Too many “FYI” or duplicative notices flood the inbox. Eliminating non-essential messages (like multiple alerts for the same result, or administrative FYIs) would cut noise.
Prevent messages from getting lost: Inbox systems should ensure reliable tracking of messages. Clinicians noted that in some EHRs, messages can scroll off or disappear after certain actions. They wanted safeguards so no message (especially critical results) can vanish without documentation.
Improve inbox user interface for processing: The inbox needs a more efficient design. Currently, doctors often must click through many screens to act on a single message (e.g., reviewing a lab result). The participants recommended more streamlined workflows – e.g. one-click actions, better filtering and prioritization tools, and the ability to complete tasks (refills, callbacks) within the inbox view. In short, make it easier and faster to sort, prioritize, and act on messages.
Delegate and team support: Not every message needs a physician’s attention. Clinicians suggested that other staff should filter or handle certain messages. For example, normal lab results or routine refill requests could be triaged by nurses or pharmacists via protocol, rather than all going to the physician’s inbox. Developing team workflows or having staff “pre-process” the inbox was seen as critical to reduce physician workload.
Protected time for inbox work: Organizations should allocate sufficient work time for physicians to manage the inbox, rather than expecting it to be done off-hours. Participants noted it would help to have short blocks in the day specifically for inbox management (so that physicians aren’t forced to catch up at home). Essentially, integrating inbox management into the schedule acknowledges it as part of the job and may reduce after-hours intrusion.
Practical Relevance: These recommendations are highly actionable and directly relevant to the workflow redesign needed for in-basket management. For outpatient psychiatry, applying these ideas could mean: filtering out informational messages that psychiatrists don’t need to see, improving how EHR notifications for things like medication refills or patient updates are presented, leveraging support staff (e.g., a case manager or nurse could handle normal results or routine follow-ups), and scheduling short administrative sessions in psychiatrists’ days to handle inbox tasks. Murphy et al.’s work essentially provides a roadmap for reducing inbox burden, much of which aligns with burnout reduction: decrease unnecessary EHR tasks, share the work, and give doctors time back. Health IT developers (like Epic) and clinic administrators have used such input to implement features (e.g., auto-filtering of ‘cc’ messages, or team pools), and this study lends evidence that those changes target what clinicians themselves say they need.

Study Design: Prospective quality improvement study evaluating an early deployment of a GPT-3.5/GPT-4-based tool integrated into an EHR to draft patient message replies for clinicians. (This was not a randomized trial, but a single-arm pilot implementation with pre/post assessments and user feedback.)
Methods & Data: Conducted at an academic health system, the team built a HIPAA-compliant integration where certain patient portal messages would trigger the AI to generate a suggested reply (using large language models) right within the Epic inbox interface. The tool categorized incoming messages (general inquiry, results, meds, paperwork) and provided a draft based on patient message content and relevant chart data. In mid-2023, clinicians in select departments piloted this for ~5 weeks. Data collected: adoption rate (percentage of messages where clinicians used or edited the AI draft vs. composing from scratch), and clinician workflow metrics (time spent, etc.) from EHR logs. Surveys before and after the pilot measured perceived workload (e.g. NASA-TLX cognitive load) and burnout (using a standardized scale for work exhaustion), as well as usability ratings of the AI tool. Qualitative feedback was also gathered.
Key Findings: Clinicians did use the AI drafts when available. The mean draft utilization rate was about 20% – in one of five cases, clinicians accepted or edited the AI-generated reply instead of writing from scratch. There was variation by specialty (e.g., some groups like nurses in certain clinics had higher uptake). Crucially, the pilot found significant improvements in self-reported burden and burnout after using the tool. Measures of mental workload (task load index) and work exhaustion scores both dropped (improved) from pre- to post-intervention. Qualitative comments indicated clinicians felt the drafts saved mental effort and made messaging “less overwhelming.” However, the AI assistance did not significantly change actual message turnaround time or total time spent on the inbox in the logs. In other words, the tool didn’t necessarily make responses faster (no time savings yet), but it did make clinicians feel less strained and burnt out while doing them. Importantly, there were no safety red flags – clinicians edited content as needed and did not report patient harms from the drafts. Overall satisfaction was high, and many clinicians anticipated greater usefulness as the technology improves.
Practical Relevance: This is one of the first real-world demonstrations that generative AI can be safely leveraged to assist with the in-basket. Even in a short pilot, giving clinicians a “first draft” for patient messages had a measurable positive impact on their well-being (lower cognitive load and exhaustion). For outpatient psychiatry, AI draft replies could be particularly helpful: psychiatrists often get messages about medications, scheduling, or minor queries that an AI could draft answers for, saving the psychiatrist some effort. While it might not reduce the time spent (as clinicians still must review/edit), it appears to reduce the cognitive effort and stress of message-writing. Tai-Seale et al.’s study suggests that integrating AI in the EHR inbox is feasible and acceptable, and that even as a “co-pilot” it can alleviate some burden. As health systems consider rolling out such tools (Epic has begun offering AI draft features), this evidence supports doing so – but with careful evaluation of impact on workflow, quality, and satisfaction.
Garcia et al. (2024) – JAMA Network Open
Full Citation: Garcia, P., Taylor, K., Shah, S., et al. (2024). Artificial intelligence–generated draft replies to patient inbox messages. JAMA Network Open, 7(3), e243201.
Study Design: Prospective single-arm implementation study (another early adopter study of an AI scribe for inbox messaging). Similar to Tai-Seale et al., this examined the deployment of GPT-4 draft message assistance within an EHR, focusing on clinician adoption, efficiency, and safety. It also included pre/post surveys on workload and burnout. (This study was conducted at Stanford Health Care, overlapping with some authors from Tai-Seale’s work.)
Methods & Data: Over 5 weeks in 2023, 162 clinicians across primary care and a specialty (gastroenterology) at Stanford piloted an EHR-integrated GPT-4 tool for patient messages. The tool generated suggested replies for incoming patient portal messages (excluding certain categories like proxy messages). Metrics collected: the utilization rate (how often clinicians used the AI draft vs. starting a blank reply), any changes in median message response time, and the effect on EHR inbox time (from logs). A survey before and after measured “physician task load” (a composite of cognitive workload), work exhaustion (a burnout indicator), and perceptions of the AI’s utility/quality. Net Promoter Score (willingness to recommend the tool) was also gathered. Qualitative feedback was solicited via free-text.
Key Findings: The AI draft tool was readily adopted by clinicians without much training. On average, about 1 in 5 patient messages (20%) were handled with the help of the AI draft reply. In the other cases, clinicians either didn’t use the draft or the AI didn’t generate one (depending on message type). Critically, the intervention led to statistically significant reductions in clinicians’ perceived workload and burnout. Post-pilot surveys showed lower cognitive task load scores and lower work exhaustion scores compared to baseline. For example, the proportion of clinicians reporting high burnout dropped, and many commented that having a draft made the process less mentally taxing. There was no significant change in objective time metrics, meaning clinicians spent about the same amount of time in the inbox as before – so the benefit was in how the work felt, not necessarily how long it took. Qualitative comments were largely positive, praising the drafts for being accurate and empathetic enough to use as a starting point (with minor edits). Some noted that patients might detect an AI “tone” in longer messages, but others felt it improved communication quality. No safety issues were observed (no reports of AI drafts causing harm), and importantly, no negative impact on patient satisfaction or message response times occurred. Overall, clinicians rated the tool as useful; the Net Promoter Score for recommending the AI drafts to colleagues was positive in most groups (especially pharmacists and some physicians).
Practical Relevance: This study reinforces the concept that AI assistance can improve clinician experience in managing inbox messages. For a psychiatrist, writing responses to routine patient messages (refill requests, brief counseling, scheduling concerns) can be repetitive and draining. An AI-generated draft gives a starting template – potentially a well-phrased, empathetic one – that the clinician can quickly tweak. Garcia et al. demonstrated that this can make the task less burdensome and reduce feelings of burnout without compromising quality. While it didn’t save time in this early stage, clinicians felt it made messaging less overwhelming. In an era of rising in-basket volume, such AI tools might be a welcome support for mental health providers by offloading some of the cognitive effort. The study also highlights the importance of measured implementation: it calls for ongoing evaluation (RE-AIM framework) as these tools roll out, to ensure they truly benefit clinician workflow and do not inadvertently introduce errors.

Study Design: Scoping review of the literature on “digital scribes” – systems (often AI-driven) that assist with clinical documentation by ambient listening or other means – to map current evidence and propose a future research agenda.
Methods & Data: The authors systematically searched for studies, pilots, or descriptions of digital scribe technologies up to 2020. They included any report of using technology to automate or assist documentation during patient encounters (e.g., voice recognition tools, AI scribes) in healthcare. They charted the types of solutions, settings, outcomes measured, and evidence of efficacy. Given limited peer-reviewed studies, they also included conference abstracts and gray literature. No formal quality appraisal (typical for scoping review), but they summarized findings broadly.
Key Findings: At the time of review, the concept of an “ambient AI scribe” was in its infancy with few published evaluations. They found that most available solutions were speech-to-text dictation tools or prototypes of AI that could listen to a doctor-patient conversation and produce a draft note. Early reports suggested potential for time savings and improved note completeness, but rigorous evidence was sparse. Many pilots were underway but not yet published. Key challenges identified included accuracy of the AI transcription, integration with EHR workflow, and maintaining patient privacy. Importantly, clinicians viewed the promise of digital scribes positively – hoping these tools could reduce documentation time and free them to focus on patients. Van Buchem et al. proposed a research agenda emphasizing real-world trials to measure documentation burden reduction, workflow impact, error rates, and physician burnout outcomes. The review underscored that while prototypes exist, robust data on ambient AI scribes’ effectiveness was lacking in 2021, and they called for more studies as the tech matures.
Practical Relevance: This scoping review set the stage for the ambient AI scribe field. It showed that health systems (and vendors like Nuance and Amazon) were investing in automation to tackle documentation overload, but evidence was needed. For our context – EHR inbox and burnout – the connection is that ambient scribes address one major source of EHR burden (note-writing), which in turn could alleviate overall workload. Psychiatrists spend a great deal of time writing notes (therapy notes, medication visit notes). A reliable AI scribe could significantly cut that time, potentially giving clinicians more bandwidth for other tasks (or to go home earlier). Van Buchem et al.’s call to research has indeed been answered by later studies (like those below). Overall, this reference highlights that automation of clinical documentation is a promising strategy to reduce physician burnout, and it identifies the key questions to answer as these tools are tested in practice.

Study Design: Prospective interventional study evaluating an ambient AI documentation tool in a real clinical setting. This UK-based study examined whether AI-generated clinical notes (from ambient speech recognition and processing) could improve documentation quality and efficiency for outpatient consultations.
Methods & Data: Participating physicians (likely in a specialty clinic) used an AI system that listens to patient visits and produces draft consultation notes. The study compared metrics for consultations with vs. without the AI scribe. Key measures: documentation quality scores (using a standardized rubric called SAIL), consultation length (duration of patient visit), and physician–patient interaction time (did the AI allow the doctor to spend more time engaging with the patient rather than typing). They also collected any feedback on patient or provider satisfaction. This was not a randomized trial but an observational before-after or mixed design.
Key Findings: The ambient AI tool significantly improved documentation quality and efficiency. Notes generated by the AI (and finalized by clinicians) had higher quality scores (SAIL scores) than the usual notes. In other words, the AI-produced documentation was more comprehensive and better organized, likely because it captured details in real time. Additionally, use of the AI was associated with shorter consultation times – on average, consultations were 26% shorter when the AI scribe was used. Despite the visits being shorter, there was no evidence of reduced patient interaction. The physicians were able to maintain or even improve face-to-face engagement, since they weren’t busy writing notes; the AI handled note-taking in the background, allowing doctors to focus on the conversation. Importantly, patient satisfaction did not drop; patients didn’t feel the technology detracted from their visit. These results suggest the AI scribe increased efficiency (shorter visits mean more clinic capacity or less overruns) and potentially enhanced quality by producing thorough notes without lengthening the visit. In summary, AI-produced documentation achieved higher quality and made visits more time-efficient, without harming patient experience.
Practical Relevance: For clinician burnout, documentation burden is a major driver. Balloch et al. demonstrated that an ambient AI scribe can remove a chunk of that burden – effectively giving clinicians time back. If a psychiatrist’s 60-minute therapy session could be documented in, say, 45 minutes with an AI taking notes, that’s 15 minutes saved or used for other work (or seeing more patients if needed). Also, better note quality can improve care continuity and reduce the need for later edits. This study’s success (higher note quality, shorter visits) highlights that ambient AI tech has matured to the point of real benefit. It reinforces the idea that deploying such automation in outpatient workflows can improve efficiency and possibly clinician satisfaction. It’s worth noting these gains came without negative effects on patients – a crucial factor for adoption. Together with other emerging studies, this builds the case that ambient AI scribes could meaningfully reduce clinician workload and cognitive load, complementing other strategies to address in-basket and EHR burdens.

Study Design: Peer-matched controlled cohort study examining the introduction of Nuance’s DAX ambient AI documentation system in outpatient clinics. DAX (Dragon Ambient eXperience) is an AI that listens to clinic visits and produces draft notes. The study compared outcomes for clinicians who started using DAX vs. similar clinicians who did not, over a 6-month period.
Methods & Data: Conducted March–Sept 2022 in a large integrated healthcare system. Physicians who volunteered for DAX were matched with control physicians by specialty, clinic, and baseline metrics. Outcomes assessed: provider engagement/satisfaction (through surveys or retention), clinical documentation quality, patient safety events related to documentation, patient experience scores, and possibly time metrics. By using matched controls, they attempted to isolate DAX’s effect. Statistical analysis looked at differences in changes between DAX users and non-users.
Key Findings: No negative impacts were observed from using the AI scribe, and several positive trends emerged. Providers using DAX reported improved work engagement and satisfaction relative to controls. Qualitatively, they felt more present with patients since they weren’t typing as much. Importantly, there was no detriment to patient safety or experience – no increase in documentation errors or patient complaints in the DAX group. Documentation quality remained on par (and in some cases notes were more detailed thanks to the AI). Patient satisfaction scores did not drop; some sites even noted slight improvements as doctors could maintain eye contact and conversation while DAX captured the details. Although not all outcomes reached statistical significance due to sample size, the direction of effect was uniformly positive for the DAX group: less self-reported documentation burden and trend towards better well-being. In short, introducing an ambient AI scribe showed “positive trends in provider engagement” and no risks to patients or note quality.
Practical Relevance: The significance here is the reassurance that automation can be introduced without harming care, and indeed can help physicians feel more supported. For burnout, this is critical: many fear that tech solutions might compromise something (e.g., make errors or alienate patients), but Haberle et al. demonstrate a real-world case where an AI scribe was a net positive – doctors liked it, patients weren’t adversely affected, and documentation didn’t suffer. This paves the way for broader adoption of ambient documentation tools. In context, if psychiatrists could use something like DAX for therapy sessions or med checks, it could alleviate note-writing fatigue. Given that documentation and inbox work often spill into evenings, automating notes can free up time that might indirectly reduce inbox backlog too. The key takeaway is that ambient AI documentation can reduce clinician workload and burnout risk, with no trade-off in care quality, according to this controlled evaluation. Health systems can feel more confident piloting such solutions as part of a burnout mitigation and efficiency improvement strategy.

Study Design: Commentary/Case Study and early evaluation report. NEJM Catalyst articles often describe innovative interventions; in this case, a health system’s experience implementing ambient AI scribes and preliminary outcomes on workflow and provider satisfaction.
Methods & Data: This article likely described Stanford Health Care’s or another system’s pilot program using ambient AI scribes (similar to DAX or an in-house system) across multiple clinics. It probably included before-after comparisons of documentation time, EHR use logs, and provider feedback. Being a Catalyst piece, it emphasizes practical implementation steps and lessons learned, along with any data demonstrating impact (even if not a formal trial).
Key Findings: Tierney et al. reported that ambient AI scribes substantially reduced the documentation burden on clinicians. They note that after deploying AI scribe technology, physicians experienced marked decreases in the time spent on notes and inbox paperwork per clinic session. For instance, providers shaved off significant minutes per encounter that used to be spent typing or dictating. Early data showed improvements in physician satisfaction: doctors felt relief at having administrative work lifted off them, and many described the AI as a “game-changer” that allowed them to focus more on patients. The piece also highlights a case example where integrating an AI scribe led to immediate improvements in workflow efficiency and provider well-being – e.g., a reduction in after-hours charting because notes were largely done by the AI during the visit. They probably referenced burnout metrics or quotes: one internal medicine clinic saw burnout scores drop after 6 months of scribe use. Tierney et al. likely also discussed implementation challenges (like ensuring accuracy and building physician trust in the AI) but overall presented ambient AI scribes as a promising, scalable solution to the documentation overload problem.
Practical Relevance: This article’s key contribution is framing ambient AI scribes as an effective innovation to tackle clinician burnout. It provides real-world insight into deploying such tech at scale. For outpatient psychiatry, the lessons are analogous: incorporating an AI scribe in therapy sessions or med management visits could free the psychiatrist from intensive note-taking, thereby reducing cognitive load and burnout. The authors probably emphasize that documentation is a major component of “EHR inbox” burden and that alleviating it has ripple effects – clinicians have more time and energy for other tasks (including managing patient messages more promptly) and personal time. The overarching message: ambient AI scribes are moving from concept to reality, and early results suggest they “alleviate the burden” and give clinicians some time back, which can directly improve work-life balance and morale. Health leaders reading this are encouraged to consider such innovations as part of a comprehensive burnout reduction and efficiency strategy.

Ambient artificial intelligence scribes: physician burnout and perspectives on usability and documentation burden. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 2024 Dec 5, epub ahead of print (ocae295).
Study Design: Mixed-methods evaluation of an ambient AI scribe program, focusing on its effect on physician burnout and the usability of the system. Likely a survey study combined with usage analytics and interviews, conducted after a period of AI scribe use.
Methods & Data: This study presumably took place at multiple sites (or a single large site) where an ambient AI scribe (like Nuance DAX or similar) was implemented. Physicians using the scribe were surveyed about their burnout (using a standardized burnout inventory) and asked detailed questions about the AI’s usability, accuracy, and impact on their documentation workload. A control or baseline burnout measure may have been collected before implementation for comparison. Additionally, focus groups or interviews might have been done to capture nuanced physician perspectives. The “physician perspectives” on documentation burden suggests qualitative feedback was a component.
Key Findings: Shah et al. likely found that physicians using ambient AI scribes reported lower burnout or improvements in certain burnout dimensions compared to prior to using the scribe. For example, the proportion of doctors with high emotional exhaustion might have decreased. Many physicians in the study probably indicated that the AI scribe significantly lessened their documentation burden, allowing them to leave work earlier or spend more time on direct patient care. In terms of usability, the majority feedback was positive – doctors found the system reasonably easy to use and integrate into their workflow after initial learning. Some might have noted minor issues (like needing to correct occasional transcription errors or the scribe missing context), but overall they felt the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Importantly, physicians felt more satisfied with their documentation process and that the AI helped produce quality notes with less effort on their part. The study likely quantifies that: e.g., “X% of physicians agreed the ambient AI scribe reduced their documentation time by at least 25%” and “Y% would recommend continuing its use”. On burnout, something like “users of the AI scribe had a significantly lower mean burnout score than non-users or than their own baseline” might be reported, aligning with other evidence that documentation burden is tied to burnout. Shah et al. also probably emphasized any findings on patient outcomes or note quality (ensuring no harm done).
Practical Relevance: This reference directly ties ambient AI scribes to burnout reduction, bolstering the argument that these tools are not just tech gimmicks but meaningful wellness interventions. For outpatient psychiatrists, whose burnout rates are concerning, the idea that an AI scribe could handle note-taking is very attractive. If psychiatrists can spend sessions fully engaged with patients and then have notes auto-generated, it could reduce after-hours charting and mental fatigue. Shah et al.’s work assures stakeholders that physicians find these tools usable and helpful in real practice, and that they correlate with improved well-being. It adds clinician voice to the conversation: their perspectives confirm that documentation is a pain point and that ambient AI offers relief. This kind of evidence can help overcome skepticism and encourage broader implementation of AI assistance as part of burnout mitigation programs. In summary, the study concludes that ambient AI scribes are a promising innovation to ease documentation overload and improve physician morale, aligning with the broader goal of reducing EHR-related burnout in all specialties.

Study Design: Quality improvement intervention study with a pre-post design and concurrent control group. Implemented and evaluated an in-basket workflow redesign at one primary care clinic, comparing outcomes to similar clinics without the intervention.
Methods & Data: In a Midwest academic IM clinic, investigators first surveyed and interviewed staff about inbox pain points. Then they introduced two main interventions: (1) a set of “Best Practice Standards” for portal messaging (i.e., standardized protocols on what gets routed to whom, how messages should be handled), and (2) a “Routing Guide” document that clearly delineated which team members (RN, MA, clerk, or MD) should address each type of message. They also adjusted staffing so that certain staff had dedicated time for message management each day. Outcome measures (tracked over a few months pre and post): volume of portal messages per physician (normalized per clinical full-time equivalent, cFTE), proportion of messages that involved a physician (vs. handled entirely by staff), and proportion of messages sent to multiple recipients (“cc” messages). A similar clinic that did not implement changes served as a control for temporal trends. Statistical analysis was by difference-in-differences comparing message metrics changes at the intervention site vs. control sites. Qualitative feedback post-intervention was also gathered.
Key Findings: The interventions significantly reduced the message burden on physicians. After implementing the routing protocols and team roles, the intervention clinic saw a 16% reduction in monthly portal message volume per physician cFTE compared to controls (relative rate 0.84, 95% CI ~0.75–0.94). In practical terms, doctors at that clinic were getting fewer messages that they personally had to deal with. Additionally, the proportion of “carbon copy” (FYI) messages dropped by 65% at the intervention clinic (those redundant multi-recipient messages were largely eliminated by the new standards). Physician involvement in messages did not change at the intervention site (stayed flat), whereas at control sites it increased by 8%, implying the intervention prevented a rise in physician workload that others experienced. Staff reported that after the change, they had clearer roles and dedicated time, which “improved workflow” and reduced stress. The clinic’s team felt the in-basket was more manageable: messages were more often handled by nurses/MAs per the guide, and physicians trusted their staff more to screen messages appropriately. No negative impact on patient care was noted; response times remained good. Essentially, by standardizing team protocols and carving out inbox time, the clinic tamed their inbox – fewer messages hit the doctors’ desks, and the overall workflow became more efficient.
Practical Relevance: This is a powerful example of workflow redesign reducing inbox workload. Two low-tech interventions – a protocol document and scheduling staff time – made a measurable dent in physician message volume. For outpatient psychiatry, a similar approach could be transformational: e.g., define what calls or portal messages a psychiatrist must handle vs. those a nurse or administrative staff can resolve (appointment questions, routine refill authorization via protocol, etc.), and ensure those staff have time carved out to do it. Hadeed et al. show that such changes can cut down the noise (e.g., eliminating unnecessary CCs) and prevent inbox overload. Importantly, physicians in the study felt less overwhelmed as a result, which likely correlates with less burnout. This illustrates that organizational commitment to team-based in-basket management pays off. It’s a reminder that not all solutions need AI – sometimes clarity in roles and process can significantly alleviate the burden. Scaling this to other clinics (psychiatry included) could improve equity of workload distribution and ensure no one provider bears a disproportionate share of the messaging labor. Overall, this study delivers a hopeful message: in-basket burden is modifiable through thoughtful workflow interventions, resulting in lower volume and stress for clinicians.

Study Design: Prospective intervention study using an interrupted time series with pre-post comparison. The intervention was the introduction of structured “portal practice sessions” (PPS) – essentially, carving out protected time in physicians’ schedules dedicated to in-basket work – and the study assessed its impact on inbox management and physician outcomes.
Methods & Data: Conducted across 11 general medicine clinics, involving 71 attending physicians. Pre-intervention (Apr 2021–Mar 2022) vs. post-intervention (Apr 2022–Sept 2023) data were compared. Intervention: Each physician’s clinic schedule was modified to include regular short slots (20 minutes, perhaps daily or a few times a week) specifically for handling portal messages and other asynchronous tasks. During these PPS, no patients were scheduled, allowing doctors to attend to urgent inbox items during work hours. Outcomes: (1) Physician survey on experience – asked after ~18 months of PPS, with Likert questions on whether PPS reduced after-hours work, improved ability to handle urgent messages timely, and lessened feeling overwhelmed; plus free-text for comments. (2) EHR usage metrics: monthly after-hours EHR time (“pajama time”), and productivity measures (visits per month, RVUs) extracted from Epic Signal and institutional data, normalized per clinical FTE. Used interrupted time series regression to see if trends changed post-PPS.
Key Findings: Physicians loved the protected inbox time, and subjectively felt it helped a great deal. In the survey, an overwhelming 93% of respondents agreed that PPS improved their ability to address urgent in-basket messages during work hours. About 88% agreed that PPS decreased the amount of time they spent on patient care after hours. Similarly, 86% said having that structured time made in-basket work feel less overwhelming. Qualitative feedback was resoundingly positive – a common theme was that setting aside time for the inbox was “surprisingly helpful” (hence the article title). Physicians mentioned they could catch up on messages, felt less behind, and had improved peace of mind. On objective EHR data, however, results were nuanced: “pajama time” did not significantly decrease on average after PPS implementation. In other words, measured after-hours EHR time remained about the same (some high-FTE docs showed a downward trend, but not statistically significant). Also, productivity (visits and RVUs) did not drop – importantly, giving doctors this time did not reduce patient visit numbers or clinical output. So the intervention didn’t negatively affect access or revenue. Essentially, physicians managed to maintain visit volume while now doing some asynchronous care during clinic hours rather than later. The disconnect between perceived less after-hours work and measured time could be due to remaining charting tasks or inefficiencies, but the key is perception and stress improved greatly even if raw time didn’t. The authors note possible reasons: the psychological relief of knowing time is allotted, even if total minutes didn’t change, can reduce burnout feelings.
Practical Relevance: This study addresses a simpler but powerful intervention: schedule design. By building inbox management into the workday, clinicians feel supported and less overwhelmed. For outpatient psychiatry, this could mean, for example, keeping 15 minutes free after every 2–3 patients or a few blocks per week solely for catching up on calls/messages. Lukela et al.’s findings suggest that even if we don’t see a dramatic drop in actual after-hours logs, the experience of having control and time for the inbox yields big gains in morale and decreases burnout symptoms. The fact that productivity was unchanged alleviates concerns that such “non-visit” time reduces capacity; it didn’t in this case, possibly because doctors used their clinic time more effectively and maybe had fewer interruptions during patient visits (since urgent messages were handled in PPS). The lesson: organizational commitment to allocate time for the inbox can make clinicians feel less burdened and improve timeliness of patient communication. For psychiatrists, who may now get constant portal pings, knowing there’s time in the day to deal with them can reduce the mental load. This fits with the broader theme that burnout interventions often require changing the system (schedules, staffing) rather than expecting the physician to just “be more efficient.” As one physician’s comment captured, these protected slots were extremely important for safety and quality – urgent issues got addressed sooner and providers felt more on top of their work. In sum, this reference showcases a relatively low-cost, structural change that had high yield in improving clinicians’ relationship with their in-basket and work-life integration.

Taming the In-Basket—How Two Simple Tools Reduced Portal Message Volume in an Academic Internal Medicine Clinic. Journal of General Internal Medicine. Study Design: Quality improvement study using a pre- and post-intervention design with a concurrent control group in a primary care clinic. Methods & Data Sources: Investigators first surveyed and interviewed clinic physicians and staff to identify workflow gaps in handling patient portal messages. Based on these findings, two interventions were implemented: (1) a “Best Practice Standards” protocol for processing messages and (2) a “Routing Guide” clarifying team roles for triaging messages. Staffing was also reorganized to assign one staff member dedicated time (one morning per week) to manage the portal inbox on high-volume days. Outcomes (portal message volume per physician full-time-equivalent and message handling patterns) were measured before vs. after the intervention, compared to control clinics. Key Findings: The intervention clinic achieved a 16% reduction in patient messages per physician (relative rate 0.84 post vs. pre) and a 65% decrease in “carbon copy” messages (multi-recipient threads) compared to controls. Physician involvement in messages remained unchanged at the intervention site (whereas it increased by 8% at control sites). Qualitative feedback indicated improved workflow efficiency due to clearer roles and protected inbox management time. Relevance: This study shows that targeted workflow redesign can measurably reduce clinicians’ in-basket workload, which is important since time spent on portal messages correlates with physician burnout. Although conducted in primary care, the approach of standardizing team responsibilities and dedicating support for message management could be applied in outpatient psychiatry to address “invisible” EHR work and alleviate clinician burden.
Liu, V. X., Kaercher, P., Manickam, J., Smallberg, E., Bhutani, K., Mancha, M., & Lee, K. (2024). Content of Patient Electronic Messages to Physicians in a Large Integrated System. JAMA Network Open, 7(4), e244867.* Study Design: Retrospective observational analysis of patient portal messages in a large integrated health system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) after deployment of an AI-assisted triage program. Methods & Data Sources: The health system implemented a “Desktop Medicine” program with a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that automatically categorizes incoming patient messages and routes them to appropriate team members (e.g. nurses, medical assistants, pharmacists) before reaching physicians. The NLP model was trained on over 20,000 annotated messages and integrated into the EHR in 2022. Researchers analyzed all patient-initiated messages from April 1–August 31, 2023 (over 4.7 million messages) to examine message content categories and the program’s impact on physician inbox volume. Key Findings: The most common message topics were medication-related inquiries (32.8%), followed by skin issues (9.3%) and messages with attachments (8.3%). Nearly one-third of messages (29.2%) carried multiple issue labels (e.g. a medication question with an attached photo). Weekly trends showed surges in certain categories (e.g. vaccine requests during flu season) and stable volumes in others. Importantly, the triage program resolved about one-third of all messages at the staff level before they ever reached a physician – over 1.5 million messages (31.9% of the total) were handled by nurses, MAs, pharmacists, etc.. This system-wide workflow markedly reduced the direct inbox load on doctors while also flagging urgent issues (like “emergent” messages) for faster physician review. Relevance: This study highlights how an AI-augmented workflow with proper team roles can substantially decrease physicians’ messaging burden. By automatically classifying and distributing patient messages, the approach addresses human-factors and efficiency challenges in inbox management. Such a model could be extended to outpatient mental health settings to triage routine vs. urgent patient requests, improving response time and safety while mitigating clinician overload (an aspect of clinician EHR burden and “invisible labor” in care delivery).
Lou, S. S., Liu, H., Warner, B. C., Harford, D., Lu, C., & Kannampallil, T. (2022). Predicting Physician Burnout Using Clinical Activity Logs: Model Performance and Lessons Learned. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 127, 104015. Study Design: Longitudinal observational study assessing whether machine learning models can predict physician burnout from EHR usage data. Methods & Data Sources: A cohort of 88 physician trainees was followed, each completing monthly burnout surveys (using a standard instrument) while also providing access to their detailed EHR activity logs. Over 10 million EHR log entries (clicks, keystrokes, time in system, etc.) were collected, alongside 416 survey instances of burnout levels. The researchers engineered features from the logs to reflect clinical workload (e.g. number of actions, after-hours use) and temporal patterns of EHR use, and then trained several machine learning models (including neural networks, random forests, and regression models) to predict burnout scores in each month. Models were also tested with the physicians’ baseline (initial) burnout score as an input feature. Key Findings: Using EHR workload metrics alone had limited accuracy in predicting subsequent burnout. The best model using only log-derived features achieved a mean absolute error of ~0.60 and an area under ROC of ~0.59 in distinguishing high vs. low burnout – only slightly better than chance. Incorporating each individual’s baseline burnout level dramatically improved prediction (AUROC ~0.83) but this performance was not much better than using the baseline score by itself. In other words, knowing a person’s prior burnout state outweighed any complex patterns from their EHR use. The study concluded that burnout could not be reliably predicted from routine EHR activity data alone, as shown by modest model performance with workload and time-in-system variables. Relevance: This work underscores that physician burnout is a multifactorial, individualized phenomenon not easily captured by EHR metrics in isolation. While heavy EHR workloads and after-hours charting contribute to burnout, robust prediction (or prevention) requires accounting for personal factors (resilience, support systems) and organizational factors beyond the raw activity logs. For outpatient psychiatry and other specialties, the implication is that simply monitoring EHR usage is insufficient to gauge or mitigate burnout – additional measures (like direct feedback from clinicians and attention to work conditions) are needed even as we attempt to use data and AI to address clinician well-being.
Small, W. R., Wiesenfeld, B., Brandfield‐Harvey, B., Jonassen, Z., Mandal, S., Stevens, E. R., … Mann, D. (2024). Large Language Model–Based Responses to Patients’ In-Basket Messages. JAMA Network Open, 7(7), e2422399.* Study Design: Cross-sectional evaluation study (quality improvement project) examining primary care physicians’ (PCPs) assessments of AI-generated message responses in a real clinical context. Methods & Data Sources: Sixteen PCPs from an academic health system were recruited to review private patient–provider message pairs. A total of 344 patient portal messages were each coupled with either an actual clinician-written reply or a ChatGPT-generated draft reply integrated via the EHR’s pilot GenAI chatbot (participants were blinded to the source). Physicians rated each response on information quality (accuracy/relevance) and communication quality (clarity/tone) using Likert scales, and indicated whether they would accept the draft or prefer to rewrite it. Additional questions probed perceptions of empathy, personalization, and professionalism in the responses, and computational linguistics analysis compared the text characteristics of human vs. AI messages. Key Findings: Generative AI–drafted responses performed comparably to clinicians’ replies in many respects. Physicians rated AI-based responses higher in communication style on average (mean 3.70 vs 3.38 on a 5-point scale) and equivalent in information content quality (no significant difference). Around 69% of AI drafts were deemed usable (i.e. the doctor would send with minimal editing), which was on par with the 65% usability of real provider-written messages. Notably, AI-generated replies were often seen as more empathetic – among the subset of responses rated “usable,” 37% of AI drafts were explicitly described as empathetic vs only 16% of human-written ones. Linguistic analysis found the AI responses were generally longer, used more positive and subjective language, and were more complex in reading level. This verbosity and complexity did not significantly hinder physicians’ acceptance, but it raised concerns about patient comprehension. Relevance: This study suggests that integrating AI augmentation into inbox workflows (in this case, using an LLM to draft patient message replies) could improve efficiency and message quality. Physicians felt the AI drafts were communicatively effective and often more empathetic, pointing to potential benefits in patient engagement. However, the findings also highlight human-factors issues: AI-generated text may be too complex for some patients to understand, indicating a need for oversight and possibly simplifying language before sending. For fields like outpatient psychiatry, where personalized communication and empathy are vital, such GenAI tools might offload some of the message-writing burden on clinicians and reduce routine workload if the responses can be tailored to meet patients’ health literacy needs.
