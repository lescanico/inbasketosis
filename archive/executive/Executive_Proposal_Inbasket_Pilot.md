# Executive Summary

**Proposal:** Implement a pilot program to redistribute in-basket messaging workload from high-volume providers to dedicated clinic nurses, addressing critical workload disparities identified in our comprehensive Epic analytics analysis.

**Key Finding:** Our analysis of 64 providers reveals **51× variation** in in-basket workload, with top 10% of providers handling **32.4% of total messaging burden** while maintaining suboptimal response times.

**Business Case:** The pilot would free **2.7 FTE equivalent** of provider time, generate **$466K in recovered revenue**, and reduce after-hours work by **1,038 hours annually** across the department.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Invisible Workload Crisis

Our comprehensive analysis of Epic in-basket data (July 2024–June 2025) reveals a critical workload distribution crisis affecting provider well-being and patient care quality:

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- **64 providers** across 3 types (MDs: 26, NPs: 4, RFs: 34)
- **51× variation** in in-basket hours (0.033 to 168.0 hours)
- **Top 10% of providers** handle **32.4% of total messaging volume**
- **Average response time:** 3.24 days (range: 0-17 days)
- **After-hours burden:** 61.9 hours per provider annually

### 1.2 Provider Type Disparities

| Provider Type | Avg In-Basket Hours | Avg Messages | Response Time | After-Hours Work |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Nurse Practitioners** | 54.0 hours | 440 messages | 2.95 days | 67.3 hours |
| **Attending Psychiatrists** | 35.4 hours | 775 messages | 3.89 days | 89.4 hours |
| **Residents/Fellows** | 23.7 hours | 289 messages | 2.88 days | 42.1 hours |

**Key Insight:** NPs have the highest individual in-basket burden (54.0 hours), while MDs handle the highest message volume (775 messages) but with longer response times.

### 1.3 Clinical Impact

**Patient Safety Concerns:**
- **17-day maximum response time** for critical messages
- **Strong correlation (0.748)** between workload and after-hours work
- **Medical advice messages** show strongest correlation (0.787) with workload burden

**Provider Well-being:**
- High-volume providers demonstrate **3.5× longer response times**
- **After-hours work increases 2.7×** with higher messaging volumes
- **Cognitive overload** from constant task-switching between patient care and messaging
